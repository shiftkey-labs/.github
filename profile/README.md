# Welcome to ShiftKey Labs on GitHub! 

ShiftKey Labs Open Source is an initiative driven with passion to bridge the gap between classroom lessons and real-world tech industry experiences. Situated at the heart of Nova Scotia, our primary goal is to provide students with tangible experiences, ensuring they are well-prepared to take on the challenges of the modern tech world.

## Our Vision

We believe in a world where every student in Nova Scotia gets the opportunity to touch the real essence of the technology industry before even stepping into it. Through open source contributions, they can learn, grow, and pave the way for future innovations.

## What We Do

- **Open Source Projects**: We maintain a series of projects that tackle real-world problems, offering students a chance to contribute to projects that are used by thousands.

- **Mentorship**: Experienced tech professionals volunteer their time to guide our students, providing insights that textbooks can't offer.

- **Workshops and Training**: Regular sessions on the latest tech trends, tools, and best practices, ensuring our community is always up-to-date.

- **Networking**: We believe in connections. Our students get numerous opportunities to meet industry leaders, ensuring they have the right start in their careers.
