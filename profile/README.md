# Welcome to ShiftKey Labs Open Source

ShiftKey Labs Open Source is a community built by students who believe learning technology should be accessible to everyone. We know how difficult it can be to gain real-world skills, and we want to make it easier for students to start, learn, and build together.

Our goal is to create a space where Computer Science students in Nova Scotia can build projects, learn new skills, collaborate, and feel supported — whether they have experience or are just getting started.

## Our Vision

We want every CS student in Nova Scotia to have a place where they can:

- Start building real projects
- Learn by doing
- Collaborate with others
- Develop the skills needed for the tech industry

You don't need to already have an idea or experience. If you want to learn and grow, this community is for you.

## What We Do

- **Learning Repositories**  
  We maintain beginner-friendly repositories based on workshops and Academy courses to help you learn real-world skills.

- **Open Source Projects**  
  We work on different types of open source projects that students can contribute to, no matter their experience level.

- **Support for New Ideas**  
  If you have a project idea or want to start something new, you can build it here with support from the community.

- **Mentorship**  
  We connect students with mentors — experienced students, alumni, and industry professionals — who can guide them through projects and learning.

- **Low Barrier to Entry**  
  Our projects are designed to be accessible. Whether you are a beginner or looking to build on your skills, there is something for you here.

## Why ShiftKey Open Source Matters

Breaking into tech is challenging without real experience.  
ShiftKey Open Source gives students a platform to:

- Build meaningful projects
